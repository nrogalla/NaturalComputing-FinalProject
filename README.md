# TSP Solving with Physarum Algorithm and BSO

This repository contains implementations and experiments for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Physarum algorithm and the brain storm optimisation (BSO). The BSO is inspired by the human brain storming process, while the Physarum algorithm is inspired by the behavior of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, which can find the shortest path through a maze. The repository includes multiple Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and result files related to the TSP solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts and experiments in this repository, you need to have Python installed. The required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Github Physarum Algorithm

To run the Physarum algorithm for solving TSP, you can execute the `physarum.py` script:

```bash
python physarum.py
```

Alternatively, you can run the Jupyter notebook `tsp_solving_physarum.ipynb` to see a step-by-step explanation and visualization of the algorithm:

```bash
jupyter notebook tsp_solving_physarum.ipynb
```

### In-House Physarum Implementation

The `in-house_implementation_code.py` script contains an in-house implementation of the Physarum algorithm. To run this implementation and see the results, execute the following command:

```bash
python in-house_implementation_code.py
```

The results of the experiments are saved in the `output_in-house_physarum_experiements.pdf` file.
